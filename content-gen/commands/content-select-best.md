# Select Best Content for Posting

## Mission

Rank all PASS content (20+/30 scores), apply tie-breaker rules, and select EXACTLY ONE best piece for human review in `content-ready.md`.

## Process

Follow the Selector agent instructions (`agents/selector.md`) to systematically:

1. **Filter for PASS content** (20+/30 scores with ✅ PASS verdict)
2. **Rank by total score** (descending order)
3. **Apply tie-breaker rules** if multiple pieces tied for first
4. **Validate selection** against quality gates
5. **Format for content-ready.md** with posting instructions
6. **Document runner-ups** (top 3 alternatives)

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Read Scored Content

**Input Source**: `content-drafts.md` with completed scores and critic verdicts

**Required Data**:
- Total scores (Gap + Biases + Decision = XX/30)
- Critic verdict (✅ PASS or ❌ FAIL)
- Subscore breakdowns (Gap subscore, Hook subscore, Bias count)
- Content text and theme information

### Step 2: Filter and Rank

**Filter Criteria**:
- Total score ≥ 20/30
- Critic verdict: ✅ PASS
- Factually accurate (verified by Critic)

**Ranking**:
- Primary: Sort by total score (descending)
- Expected: 12-20 PASS pieces from 25 total variations

**Quality Alert**:
- If < 5 PASS pieces: Alert user that quality is below threshold
- Consider regenerating content with stronger constraints

### Step 3: Apply Tie-Breaker Rules

**If multiple pieces have same total score**, apply tie-breakers in order:

1. **Gap Selling Subscore**: Higher Gap score wins (problem clarity most important)
2. **Hook Strength**: Higher Hook subscore wins (first line = 80% of engagement)
3. **Lollapalooza Effect**: Content with 5+ biases wins (exponential persuasive power)
4. **Bias Diversity**: More unique biases wins (broader psychological appeal)
5. **Theme Novelty**: Less-used theme wins (prevents theme fatigue)
6. **Human Judgment**: If still tied, flag for manual decision

### Step 4: Validate Selection

Before finalizing, verify:

**Quality Gates**:
- [ ] Selected piece scores 20+/30 (ideally 25+/30)
- [ ] All three frameworks adequately addressed (no subscore < 5)
- [ ] Factually accurate (verified by Critic)
- [ ] High engagement potential (hook + emotional resonance)

**Platform Appropriateness**:
- [ ] Twitter/X character limits respected (280 single or thread)
- [ ] Tone matches platform (conversational, punchy)
- [ ] Format clean (line breaks, readability)

**Strategic Fit**:
- [ ] Theme aligns with user's positioning
- [ ] Message supports broader narrative
- [ ] Timing appropriate (seasonally relevant)

### Step 5: Write to content-ready.md

**Location**: `/home/rpiplewar/fast_dot_ai/poasting/content-ready.md`

**Action**: OVERWRITE file (only ONE piece should exist)

**Format**:
```markdown
# Content Ready to Post

**Date Generated:** {ISO Timestamp}
**Theme:** {Theme Name}
**Source:** {Linear Task ID}
**Total Score:** {XX/30}
